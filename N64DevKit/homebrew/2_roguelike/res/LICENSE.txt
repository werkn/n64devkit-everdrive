The assets used in this project come from the Unity Asset Store, specifically the link provided below.

I have read the license included with assets and interpreted it to indicate fair use as long as the assets are not resold and 
only distributed as part of an electronic application or game.

I am claiming fair use in this context, if this is in error please open a pull request on this repository.
